# arcolinux-deepin-minimal-beta
<p>This is an iso for arcolinux with the deepin de. Created using the scripts for arcolinx.
enjoy this de with a small selection of pre installed apps to keep bloat to a minimum, you can add the software you need after you install the system.</p>
<b>This is a beta version,do test in virtualbox before installing</b>
 
<p><b>XFCE is used as a delivery enviornment, so deepin will not be available for testing without install</b></p>

<p>Install on virtualbox or dual boot with other OS.</p>

<b> For turning on autologin </b>
 To enable autologin, edit the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file :
  - user-session=deepin
  - autologin-user=your_user_name
  - autologin-session=deepin
 
Thanks to the guys at arcolinux for helping with my queries.
Hope you have fun with this distro.
