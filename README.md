# arcolinux-deepin-minimal
<p>This is an iso for arcolinux with the deepin de. Created using the scripts for arcolinx.
enjoy this de with a small selection of pre installed apps to keep bloat to a minimum, you can add the aps you need after you install the system.</p>
<p><b>XFCE is used as a delivery enviornment, so deepin will not be available for testing without install</b></p>
<p>Install on virtualbox or on bare metal , can dual boot with other OS.</p>

<b>For turning on autologin</b>
 To enable autologin, edit the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file :
  - user-session=deepin
  - autologin-user=your_user_name
  - autologin-session=deepin
 - Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
Thanks to the guys at arcolinux for helping with my queries.
Hope you have fun with this distro.
